    <h1>BadRecovery</h1>
    <p><strong>BadRecovery</strong> (formerly OlyBmmer) is an exploit for ChromeOS devices, leveraging a vulnerability in recovery images to get arbitrary code execution or to chain to other exploits.</p>
    <p>BadRecovery unenrolls ALL devices that are EOL before 2024, and can unenroll current supported devices on kernel version 3 or lower.</p>
    <p>The exploit and writeup were released to the public on October 5th, 2024.</p>
    <p>You can read the writeup <a href="./writeup.md">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>You will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A USB drive or SD card (8 GB or larger)</li>
        <li>Something to flash the image (dd, rufus, chromebook recovery utility, etc.)</li>
        <li>A ChromeOS device that has not received the patch (see <a href="#patch">patch</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparing an image</h3>
    <p>First, you must download an official recovery image for your device. You can download them from <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/serving-builds?deviceCategory=Chrome%20OS">ChromiumDash</a> or <a href="https://chrome100.dev/">Chrome100</a>. See <a href="#modes-of-operation">modes of operation</a> for which version you'll need, usually r124 or older. Be sure you've downloaded the correct image for your device.</p>
    <p>Make sure to unzip the recovery image before proceeding to the next step!</p>
    <p>Next, you must modify the recovery image using the script included with this repository. You can use the <a href="https://binbashbanana.github.io/badrecovery/builder.html">web version</a> of the builder, though it is a fair bit slower.</p>
    <p>To get the script, run these commands on a linux machine:</p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/BinBashBanana/badrecovery
cd badrecovery</code></pre>

    <p>To modify a recovery image using the script, run</p>
    <pre><code>sudo ./build_badrecovery.sh -i &lt;image.bin&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>(Replace &lt;image.bin&gt; with the path to your recovery image bin.)</p>
    <p>The script may prompt you to install required dependencies.</p>
    <p>You can specify the mode using the <code>--type</code> argument (<code>-t</code> for short). If left unspecified, the script will automatically determine the best option based on the version and features of the recovery image.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>sudo ./build_badrecovery.sh -i image.bin -t postinst</code></pre>
    <p>The script would fail if it detected that the supplied recovery image does not meet the requirements for postinst mode (see table below).</p>
    <p>The recovery image is now modified, and is ready to be flashed to a USB drive or SD card.</p>

    <h3>Running on ChromeOS device</h3>
    <p>First, enter recovery mode. See <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595#enter">this article</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
    On the unverified payload, you must also enter developer mode, and then enter recovery mode again for BadRecovery to work.
    <strong>On Cr50 devices (most devices manufactured in 2018 or later), you must NOT be in developer mode for unenrollment to work. Ensure you are in verified mode recovery.</strong>
    In any other case, you can use either verified or developer mode recovery.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Plug in the prepared USB drive or SD card. On the unverified payload, BadRecovery will start in only a few seconds if you've done everything correctly.</p>
    <p>On any other payload, the system will recover first. This may take a while depending on the speed of your drive. On postinst and postinst_sym payloads, BadRecovery will start partway through the recovery process.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>NOTE</strong>
    If using postinst_sym and BadRecovery does not start, the path to the internal drive is incorrect.
    </blockquote>

    <p>On basic or persist payloads, reboot into verified mode after recovery completes. Optionally, you can look at VT3 and reboot early to skip postinst and save some time.</p>
    <p>On the persist payload, BadRecovery will start within a few seconds of ChromeOS booting. On basic, you must proceed through setup and the device will unenroll using <a href="https://github.com/FWSmasher/CryptoSmite">cryptosmite</a>.</p>
    <p>When BadRecovery finishes, you will usually be able to skip the 5 minute developer mode delay by immediately switching back into recovery mode to get to developer mode. (This is not required.)</p>

<h2>Patch</h2>
<p>R125 recovery images and newer are not vulnerable to this (except unverified). To determine if you can use this, follow these in order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Was your device EOL before 2024? &rarr; YES</li>
	<li>Are you on ChromeOS version 124 or lower? &rarr; YES</li>
	<li>Was your device <em>released</em> after mid-2024? &rarr; NO</li>
	<li>Does your device show `03` or lower as the last digits of the kernver (kernel version) on the recovery screen (press TAB, look at the line that starts with "TPM")? &rarr; YES</li>
	<li>Higher than `03`? &rarr; NO</li>
</ul>
